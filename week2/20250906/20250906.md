# 2. What Are the Accessibility Benefits for Good Link Text, and What Are Examples of Good Link Text ? 
- First, it makes it easier for everyone to find information quickly.
- Best practices to keep in mind while writing link texts :
    - Make sure links are visually distinct by using underlining and other visual cues, so users can easily identify and navigate them.
    - Avoid generic link texts like "here", "click here", and "more-info" as they don't provide any useful information.
    - Aim for concise and descriptive link texts, ideally between 2-5 words, that convey the link's purpose.
    - Avoid jargon and abbreviations that users may not understand.
    - Focus on the destination, not the action. For example, "user behavior results", instead of "click here to read more".
    - Don’t repeat the same link text for different destinations.
    - Place links in a way that they make sense within the surrounding text. For example, "for more details, visit our events page" instead of "Click here for more".

# 4. What Are Some Ways to Make Web Applications Keyboard Accessible?
- tabindex attribute : It allows you to adjust which elements are focusable or to change their focus order.
- basic syntax :
 <element tabindex="number">Element Text</element>

- The value of tabindex determines how the element behaves in keyboard navigation. 
- tabindex="0" : Adds the element to the natural tab order.
    for example, 
    <button>First</button>
    <div tabindex="0">Second</div>
    <a href="#">Third</a>
    Tabbing will move focus from the button to the div, then to the link, following their order in the HTML.
- tabindex="-1" : Makes an element focusable programmatically. Learn more in Javascript lecture.
- tabindex greater than 0 : Sets a custom tab order, so elements with lower positive values are focused first.
#
- accesskey is another attribute you can use to make your web project keyboard accessible. It allows you to define a key that focuses on or activates a particular element.
-   <button accesskey="s">Save</button>
    <button accesskey="c">Cancel</button>
    <a href="index.html" accesskey="h">Home</a>
    In the above code, accesskey="s" assigns the key S to the Save button. C as Cancel button in same way with S.
